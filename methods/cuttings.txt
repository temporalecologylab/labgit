Packing cuttings, especially ones with secondary branches
----------------------
Take home messages

- Repack cuttings in the evening after sampling to check labels and make packing small. (Harold said: It would take us 1-2 hours to verify our collection, cross-checking bag labels against our GPS/journal notes, while packing them into the cooler. NPR helped!)
- Keep the cuttings cold! Even while re-packing (keep the room was cold when where re-packing happens and keep the branches mostly in cooler when not re-packing or re-arranging)
- Cutting lengths: 40 cm or 18-24 inch range
- Branching species? I'm thinking that we may have taken those shrub species bags and rolled them up, like scrolls, and put an elastic band around them. As to Tim's last comment: for the subranching species we would push the twig so it sat at the bottom of the bag, and then close the bag, and roll up as much of the bag as possible. This gives a snug fit.
- Generally used two (2) Igloo Polar Cooler (120-Quart)
- We used large plastic bags from McMaster Carr. They were on the order of 18-24" long, 12" wide.
- Some species took up far less volume than others, e.g. Fraxinus was very easy. Shrubs tended to be branchy and want to practically jump out of the bag, like you describe with Vac. For those, we treated them delicately and did our best with reducing their volume inside of the cooler.

[Dan Flynn noted: Only thing I have to add is that we did add moist paper towels at some point, I think only for twigs we knew were going to keep chilled for extra treatment.]

seconding lizzie’s recommendation to keep samples cold while handling. we’ve got our hats/thermals on in that pic for a reason 

thanks for this photo, lizzie!!

Deirdre, one more reminder I have from this photo is to keep the twigs cool while re-packing (i.e., looks like the room was cold when this re-packing happened and keep the branches mostly in cooler when not re-packing or re-arranging).
