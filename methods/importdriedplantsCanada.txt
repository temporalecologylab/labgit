Regarding the importation of dried leaf material, no permit is needed. You can refer to the rules you were mentioning: https://inspection.canada.ca/plant-health/invasive-species/directives/horticulture/d-14-03/eng/1428585735857/1428585737326. They mention I think that you don't need permits to import dried leaf material from the USA. Just check twice to be sure.

I suggest bringing a copy of this document when you import the samples. The agents at the border don't always know the rules and they have to call the agency to check and that could be long and annoying.

Al alternative could be to ship them from the US to Canada. When we do this, we mention on the package that it contains leaf samples for DNA (or other) extractions and that it has no commercial value.
