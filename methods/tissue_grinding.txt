Protocols on grinding leaf tissue for CN
By Lizzie in April 2020

What we did at Weld Hill (from Dan Flynn):

I remember clearly that we did liquid N + mortar and pestle for this project. I remember filling up from the big N tank in the hallway, and doing the grinding by hand in the lab. I used to grind a lot of leaves with different methods, but Tim your recollections sound right to me. I would say if you think you might have conifers, grass / sedges, or anything else on the tougher side, you will find that mortar and pestle is difficult. Ball mills are the way to go for that stuff.

I do remember getting a price quote for a ball mill at one point, but we decided against it. It’s possible that we did use a ball mill at Harvard Forest, when we had the undergraduates out there and we could process C/N on site there. 

And how much does it matter what technology you use? There can substantial variation in C/N between different parts of a leaf, and if you are using incomplete grinding, you might end up with a poor representation of the C/N (too much stem / veiny bits). It also matters how you process the leaf, in particular being consistent about what part is ‘in’ versus ‘out’, like making sure to not include the petiole. 

If you have tiny leaves, then it doesn’t matter so much. At one point when I was doing a lot of grass samples, I was cutting tiny grass blades and dropping them, unground, into tin capsules, because I had essentially the entire leaf.
