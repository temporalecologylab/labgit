## Meetings Neil Pederson Notes

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

Added by Christophe on 22 November 2024, after meeting with Neil two times. We checked a bunch of tree cookies from the common garden experiment in Boston. Most of the species are in the Betulacea family and their rings are hard to distinguish between real and false ones. 

Below are questions that arose when I measured the rings, for which Neil provided useful insights.

###### Should the first ring after the pit be counted?

Usually, the ring around the pit should be counted as a true ring except if the late-wood boundary is weak. In that case, look at cells that might penetrate the ring which could indicate a false ring. This could be caused by a warm spell in a late season that resumed growth and stopped later in the same season. 

###### What to do with empty hearts? Estimate pit distance?

Estimate the pit as best I can, but since I have a cross-section, it's not relevant. I could substract what's missing if I wanted to be very precise.

###### For a cookie, how many measure replicates should I do?

At least 2, but 3 or 4 is ideal. E.g. if 3 measures, I should do them at 120 degrees. If the line hits a crack, or a wound, moving it a little is not a big deal. 

If I were to only take 2 measures, I would take the longest radius and its opposing line. 

###### How to distinguish interannual density fluctuations aka false rings and real rings?

Cells that go through the ring boundaries are a way to determine if they are a false ring. They tend to happen in fast-growth years in which there is a drought spell. A good way is to check all around the cookie and take the "zoom-out approach"

###### DPLR vs Cofecha?

Not very relevant to this project because it is very unlikely I will find any correlation between the years.

###### Should we use kerosene or Zing Oxide?

No. Just sand better. They use an orbital sander and finish by hand. We could also draw a line with a marker and rub it with talc

###### Should I save all of my files from Coorecorder in .pos AND .txt?

Save everything. It's also good to save a JPEG of the decisions I made. 

###### What to do when there are multiple pits.

Be as consistent as possible i.e. always choose the center one or the one you think is the main stem. 



**What's really important is to take a lot of notes, which Coorecorder is great at. **
