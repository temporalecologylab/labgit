From Darwin September 2023

The job I currently have at Stand.Earth, I got largely because of the training I received during the PhD such as how good R code should look and read, how to organize GitHub and the right way of solving coding issues if you need help. I feel it's always nice to hear when policies and procedures you make help lab members in their pursuit of a job/give them a competitive edge.
