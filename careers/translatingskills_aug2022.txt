Lizzie's scrambled notes 
11 August 2022


Tim and Cat joined us!
- Cat did a big switch - from academia to non-profit and on topics
- Tim has done a mix of research and engineering since working in the lab. At MIT in a research and industry-facing group after TempEcology lab. 
- Cat worked on her PhD chapters and worked with TNC woman (start networking, which was extremely valuable -- contacts made a different -- person wrote letters, answered questions etc.)
	- Went to the career services office
	- Different sectors operate on different time-scales (you may need to fill the position in 3-4 months; government is a year in advance)
	- Expecting results very quickly! Efficient and effective (then move onto another grant)
	- Reach out via LinkedIn and ask if they will do a 30 minute Zoom call 
	- Learn the key terms that organizations value (compassionate, driven etc.)
	
- Lizzie adds -- get lots of advice! Don't trust just one person.
- Cat's contact info is available if people ask, she can CV vs. resume info etc. 

Tim says:
- This is my story -- you're all going to have your own story. 
- Soft skills (communication)
	- Watching people give presentations, figure out how to do it better
	- Controlled environment agriculture
	- GCMS 

- "I failed many times. I used my research assistantship to learn many skills."
- At your institution, there are lots of resources that are free to you that you can leverage. 
- Very analogous 'we needed weird one-off stuff that needs to be communicated well.'
- Find a new technology, create a proof of concept -- and then communicate it. 
- Tim in my lab: Cold applied to my job (found it on Ecolog)

Cat -- I fail every day, all the time. It's constant. 
- Tim: Stuff I was building started to look more like products, than one off things. 
- Tim, "In a word, projects."
- Profit versus non-profit organization. Cat says "it's more about the organization than sector differences. Look into the organization; figure out what draws you to it." 
- Tim: "You're not mentioning the chambers, and the thousands of observations I had to take."
- Lizzie remembers Tim and NEON.
