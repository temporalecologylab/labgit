My writing is your writing
I need to fix my writing by re-reading

Read lots of books on your own (my recommendations)

Expect many drafts ... 

I go through words and best phrases

Results are past tense

Programs to use

I don't edit everything, every time -- I might focus on results and come back to captions later.
