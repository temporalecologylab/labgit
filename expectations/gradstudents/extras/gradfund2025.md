# Lab grad student expenses fund

## What the fund covers 
As of 1 September 2025 the lab has a $1000/year account for graduate student expenses not otherwise covered by the lab. I (Lizzie) hope to keep this going as long as we are not totally broke. Some examples of possible expenses (this is NOT an exhaustive list):

* Clothes/shoes for field work
* Computing related stuff
* Books you want to personally own (or I don't want to buy for the lab)
* Conference expenses outside of what I agreed to cover (don't use this for ALL conferences, the lab does try to cover a reasonable number of conferences, however, but you must present at them and there are other limits)

## How to use the fund?
* Add a tab to the labexpeneses sheet in the Teams folder with your initials followed by 'persdevfund' and ENTER ALL EXPENSES there
* Submit expenses as usual, asking Lizzie for a speedchart (we have no special 'fund' for this in the lab, so I will just manage it based on what you're buying and what funds we have).
* The fund refills 1 September each year. You can spend ahead (or combine years) if you discuss it in advance with Lizzie. 

## Does this fund apply to me?
This fund is for graduate students only. We don't have one for postdocs because coverage of their expenses is different, however if you are a postdoc in the lab with expenses similar to the above that are not being reimbursed, please discuss with Lizzie.
