Lizzie’s rules on folder structures….

data folder should be data files that are never touched and it should be outside the analyses folder

within analyses:
* input - these are files that are used ONLY as input (basically they are probably versions of the files found in the data folder)
* output - files that are generated by any script within the analyses folder
* source - for R and other scripts that are only sourced by other scripts (for example, Prep_all_data.R which is sourced in in review_analysis.R, would usually be in the source folder)
* cleaning - in some cases, when there is a lot of cleaning happening we have this folder. Source code can live in here, as long as it is about cleaning.
* stan - for stan code (also okay is source code related just to stan)
* R and other scripts that are not sourced and do not belong in some specialized folder (e.g., cleaning or labgroups in the ospree repo) should go into the main analyses folder. 

Here’s a sample analyses repo: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/vin/tree/master/davis/analyses

Note, I don't think there is one best way to organize files and folders, but for now this is what I tend to do so I think unless someone has a better plan (please feel free to make a case!).
