## What is this?
WhereDataCodeLive is an important part of data management in the Temporal Ecology Lab; it's basically where we keep notes on the files that make up each project and keep track of when data will be made public following the rules in the lab data management plan (see tempeco_DMP.pdf). 

## How do I complete my wheredatacodelive?
Great question! Please copy the markdown (.md) in ZeTemplate/ZeTemplate.md and update it for EACH of your projects in the lab. More details are in tempeco_DMP.pdf. 

## Some history (and related notes)
Until 2023, we maintained these files as Google Doc files on the lab's Google Drive. Then in November 2023, Lizzie realized we were losing files as people left the lab (annoyingly, Google Drive files are owned by those who make them, no matter what folder they are in, so when Cat Chamberlain -- for example -- made some and then left Harvard after her PhD, the files were deleted by Harvard/Google). So, in 2024 Lizzie slowly got everything switched so it could be on GitHub. 

As of December 2024, all new files should be in Markdown (.md) and always saved as .html (or .pdf) also. Files already made as Google docs are maintained as .docx and should always be printed to PDF each time they are pushed.
