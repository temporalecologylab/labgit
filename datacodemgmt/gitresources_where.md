**Where are the resources for learning git?!**
They are currently a little spread out.

1. Basics are [here](https://github.com/temporalecologylab/learn_git). Also, **highly recommended** is [a sample of how Lizzie uses git every day](https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/wiki/git-resources#what-your-life-in-git-in-terminal-may-look-like) (multiple times a day).
2. [Check out how Lizzie wants your repos set up](https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/blob/master/datacodemgmt/tempeco_git.txt).
3. Check out how Lizzie wants [your folders organized inside your repo](https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/blob/master/datacodemgmt/folderorganization.txt).
