Where are the resources for learning git?!
They are currently a little spread out.

FIRST*, basics are here: https://github.com/temporalecologylab/learn_git 

SECOND, check out how Lizzie wants your repos set up: https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/blob/master/datacodemgmt/tempeco_git.txt

THIRD, check out how Lizzie wants your folders organized inside your repo: https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/blob/master/datacodemgmt/folderorganization.txt


See also:
Resources on our lab wiki: https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/wiki/git-resources
And yet another place we keep a sample .gitignore: https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/wiki/gitignore

* Highly recommended is a sample of how Lizzie uses git every day (multiple times a day): https://github.com/temporalecologylab/labgit/wiki/git-resources#what-your-life-in-git-in-terminal-may-look-like
