If you are doing field work, lab work or anything similar:

You should *start a daily log* (in rtf or tex or txt). 

On each day give a very quick synopsis of what you did, how long it took and any notes that have no where else to go. I will give you a sample of this. This should take 3-15 minutes each day, depending on what you did and the notes you need to keep.
