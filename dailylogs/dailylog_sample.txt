San Diego 2005

2 April, Saturday:Packed and in field at 5:15 thinking I would illegally install pitfalls, but found Doug on my plot. Instead I picked out usable plots from the >48 selected and marked pitfall locations. This was dumb – I have no better idea which plots suck less by wasting my time looking at them all, all over again. And now I have mis-leading yellow flags all over the plots. Out of field at 13:15. Decided against afternoon session as I was recovering from dehydration and didn’t finish necessary data entry until after 4pm. Instead took a nap, did laundry, went shopping etc.

...

14 April, Thursday: Sorted pitfalls 09:00 – 12:00 (total of 24). Then met with Mike to go over Hobo installation (screw to installed stakes). Shopping and then went into field to do veg work. Worked on veg for 2 hours before admitting it was taking forever (decided on two diagonal transects to minimize effort of setting tape – can just set it between stakes). First tried two diagonal transects with points every .2 meters, then tried same but every .25m. Went home and looked at data, two diagonal transects every .5m gives similar results to every .25 and should take less time (especially considering I was piloting work on the low vegetation sites!). See file in veg folder “Pilot Data on How Many Points to Use.xls.”15 April, Friday: Sorted pitfalls 08:30-10:30 (total of 22, done with April pitfalls). Then went to Atlas Chemicals at 2929 Commercial and picked up ethyl alcohol ($30 cash, can only use credit cards on purchases of more than $50) from a friendly musclebuilder. Currently at Starbucks emailing. Veg sampling 15:00 – 19:30 (10 plots took until past sunset)....29 April, Friday:In field by 07:15, took 28 samples and out by 13:15 (took 20 samples on battery then replaced it but only got 8 samples out of second battery). Returned to field after two hours of charging batteries at 15:45 and took 16 samples and out by 18:45. Exhausted!30 April, Saturday:Got up and went for a run, in field by 08:00, out by 11:00 (took 12 samples). Really tired. Long shopping trip at Walmart and Home Depot in afternoon. I hate Home Depot. They sell ONE size of fence staples. Evening at Lestat’s.


<><><><><><><><><><><>San Diego 2010 season22 March 2010Doug and I hit the field today (met at 8am, walking after buying batteries at 8:30am). Nice day, sunny for a couple hours, then cloudy and cool, then oddly humid and sort of warm. We visited each bird exclosure shrub, and shook HALF the shrub for a total of 20 s (two ¼ sections shaken by Doug for 10 s (counted in my head) each, if a large section of the shrub was dead we did not include that in our ‘half’ estimate, nor shake it) onto a white dropcloth. We (I) then recorded all leps, spiders and visible Auchenorrhyncha. This means I did not count aphids, assassin bugs or mites (which we also saw – and we saw spiders eating aphids (a few times – or at least clutching them) and earwigs (once)).  We tossed all bugs back onto shrub. I estimated percent cover (in a 4 m2 I think). Out at 15:30. Bring gloves next time!Measure litter that comes off when beating next time! It really seemed like shrubs with lots of leps lost lots of leaves.Notes: •	Seemed like invasive grass was higher in exclosures (bunny-effect) which may then have cascading bottom-up effects. Would need to do pt. intercept or (better!) biomass sample the grass for this, also take soil cores.•	Also seemed like bird foraging pressure may have been higher in the drainages and decreasing as you went out of them. Next step here would be to systematically count leps on a gradient going out of several drainages.  Talked to Dan Gruner, he said:•	Take exclosures down during arthropod reproductive season – do last big count then.•	Dan has new meta-analysis on bird exclosures. Birds dynamically switching between leps and spiders depending on what they can get. •	Gripenberg & Roslin 2007 – Spatial effects of top-down/bottom-up

Saturna 2018 (in tex)

\emph{15 March 2018}\\
First sampling this year, with the lab in the middle of the lab retreat. A wonderful warm day in March (following a batch of relatively sunny days with just a couple rainy ones)! I almost went down to a t-shirt but didn't. It was still cold in the morning though. We were at the top of the bluffs around 11:15 and finished at the last plot by 12:30. \\

Also, saw the leaves for that really common orchid in the woods; she said it is probably \emph{Goodyera repens}.\\

\emph{22 March 2018}\\
I very much debated going but was out of bed by 05:30 and made it! Cool (not cold), windy and rainy on top of Saturna Bluffs at 11:00. Sat in Tracker (1998) for 30 minutes but gave up and went out in the rain. Done by 12:25 at last plot. Definitely lots of new flowers (mostly LOTUTR and \emph{erocic}) but still quiet. Saw a Galium in flower in the woods as I peed at the end! And---amazing---I got my ticket for the ferry while sitting in the pub.\\

\emph{30 March 2018}\\
A sunny day (after much cool and rain in Vancouver at least) on the ferry out, mostly cloudy for sampling (top of bluffs at 11:15, done at the last plot at 12:20). Patches of \emph{Collinsia parviflora} showing up (but not in plots). Jehane Samaha helped with sampling and we saw our first flowers in a woods plot! Finished the day starting the woodstove at Judy's (for their Easter weekend arrival) and enjoying a beer with Bruce and the resk of the White Rock Whalewatching team (and clients) at the pub. Happy long weekend!\\
