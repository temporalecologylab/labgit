Check out eligibility. 
	- Have to be still IN school (not just graduated).
	- Cannot combine wages with other federal funding.
To apply ... there is a link there to download:
	- 2 -- section B is where they see mistakes ..
		- Max is 16 weeks
		- 52 weeks salary (even though hired as 16 weeks)
	- Must SIGN it, not typed
	- Make sure all the forms match!
	- I am the employer and the academic signature person
	- Need job/company description
	- Send by email.
- Generally 5-10 days for an approval, get the contract within 10 weeks -- reimbursed at the end of every month.

Have not yet started program for summer yet. But I would be biosciences and maybe agriculture. They will have Biosciences SWPP this summer, but they don't know details or when to apply or how.

Questions are asked:

HOW do they decide who to fund?
	- Right now they fund everyone who meets criteria. 1400 in biosciences and 1500 in healthcare. (Sounds like they fund based on first-come first-serve.)

How long has program been around? 
	- Biosciences has been around since 2017; healthcare is is first year.

How often does the program change?
	- Not often as best he can tell; if you hire one student now, you have to hire two next time and you only get funding for the SECOND student. 
	- Amounts change some, $7,000 may be this summer.

Below was submitted for co-op app 
in Summer 2021
<><><><><><><><>

* Please describe in detail the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts or Math (STEAM) or Business element of the co-op student’s role.


The student will assist with several on-going ecological research projects, gaining skills making measurements of plant anatomy and phenology and data analysis. In particular this student will (1) gain field and lab work experience in identifying and measuring germinants of coniferous species used in forestry and for sustainable land management; (2) help measure and document climate change impacts on winegrowing in the Okanagan Valley using long-term phenology records and gain experience in communicating climate change impacts to date and predicted impacts. 

* Please describe in detail the co-op position, job duties, and if there is an environmental aspect of the position

The coop student will assist with several on going ecological research projects which will include: field work measuring plants and soils in Smithers, BC, using growth chambers to manipulate temperatures and measuring plant competition in those chambers, making measurements of digitized plant specimens, geo-references collection locations, obtaining and organizing phenological and climate data, basic statistical analyses and literature reviews.


* I already have a training plan for my candidate. If yes, please fill in details of your training plan. Include any onboarding procedures, courses or seminars the participant will attend, regularly scheduled meetings, etc.

For onboarding, in addition to all New Employee training required by UBC, the student will benefit from a suite of additional orientations by the PI (Wolkovich), with help from graduate students in the lab. These include an introduction to lab protocols (review of all taxonomic materials, the project specific plant-guide (taxonomy and phenology guides), basic measuring devices, field tools, computer software), an overview of the lab’s safety protocols while in the lab and field, as well as general lab and field ‘good practices,’ and an overview of the research project and related biological concepts. 

These orientations are spread out over the first days to maximize student uptake, but students can always ask questions later as they come up (as the graduate student and PI are very often available) or in regularly scheduled meetings. Additionally, the lab maintains a suite of protocols that review the step-by-step tasks required for the various methods, and the lab runs ‘scrum’ once a week when general questions are posed and answered by all in the lab.

The coop student will continue to meet weekly with a graduate student and regularly with the PI to check in projects for feedback and trouble shooting. The student will also receive additional weekly tutelage the the basics of ecological data analysis and using R statistical software during periods focused more on data entry and analysis. For (short-term this summer) field work and for lab work a graduate student will work alongside the student (and at times PI), who is always happy to answer questions and provide support. Through regular meetings with the PI, the student will be provided with frequent constructive feedback and opportunities to communicate any challenges or areas in which additional support is needed to ensure the student’s success. In addition to regular meetings and interaction while working together in the field, the PI and graduate student are generally always available to answer questions as they come up. The group maintains an open and accessible atmosphere that strives to encourage questions, and informal opportunities for conversations and feedback.

The PI will also conduct a midpoint performance evaluation, as recommended by Career Services, and will meet with the student to review the evaluation near the end of the work-learn term.

The student researcher is also welcomed at lab meetings (generally every 2 weeks in the summer) and at weekly scrum. Scrum is a weekly meeting to review what everyone in the lab is working on and to bring general questions and challenges to the group. In this way work-learn student researchers can ask questions, but also see the hurdles and issues everyone in the lab faces. Lab meeting and scrum also provide a mechanism for the student to learn about the diversity of research programs in the lab.
