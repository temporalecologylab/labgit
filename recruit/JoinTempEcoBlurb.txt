Summer 2020: Study how climate change is reshaping British Columbia’s vineyards and forests

We'll be monitoring winegrape phenology, and locating and marking a suite of tree species for community ecology studies in climate change and plant phenology. Field work will be focused in the Okanagan valley vineyards, with additional work expected in provincial parks of Manning, Babine and Call Lake (Smithers).

We're looking for enthusiastic, motivated students with a love of science and being outside, hiking, looking at plants and plant development. For more info visit temporalecology.org. If you're interested, contact Lizzie Wolkovich with your transcript, interests and background: e.wolkovich@ubc.ca.
