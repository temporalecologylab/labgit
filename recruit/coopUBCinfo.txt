From nazlyn.pirani@ubc.ca

It would be great if you could provide a co-op work term for our students that is related to their studies!  And yes, positions should be a minimum 12 weeks, 35+ hours per week/420 hours.  Normally, positions are 12 - 16 weeks and paid at least minimum wage.  Also, students must have a supervisor and since this is an academic option, there are also learning objectives, assignments and evaluations.  The mid-term evaluation would under "normal" circumstances be a site visit if you are in the lower mainland, or virtually or by phone if not.  

Regarding funding, there are many options here:  https://forestry.ubc.ca/students/undergraduate-student-portal/forestry-co-op-program/employers/funding/

Many faculty have their various funding sources/grants that contribute to the student wages.  Work Learn wouldn't qualify as it is only maximum 20 hours per week in the summer and 10 hours/week during the academic terms.

If you would like to chat further or have any question, please let me know.
Have a super week,
Nazlyn
