Hi XXX,

Thanks for your interest in the Temporal Ecology lab! If you are still interested in the lab please read on, and answer the below queries.

We're looking for a mix of people this year as we have many projects underway. Thus we have some computational tasks (across projects including a meta-analysis on seed germination and working on some statistical tasks), computational/engineering -- including efforts in setting up and working with micro-dendrometers to analyze tree growth, managing the lab website and working with git. Other tasks would include preparing tree cores for analyses and operating a new device to capture high-resolution images of the cores. General lab tasks may also arise. 

You do not need to be good or have experience related to all the below queries, but we ask in the hopes to have some diversified skills across the lab. Our most important requirement is enthusiasm and a commitment to working hard and learning new skills. 

A) What is your computational experience? For example, what (if any) computer languages do you know and give an example of how you use them. Did you ever use Git?
B) What is your engineering experience and interest?
C) What (if any) experience do you have with ecological or biological lab work? If you want to participate in fieldwork, please also tell me your experience with field work and/or being outdoors for long, sometimes hot days? 
D) Do you have any experience with photography, blogging or website management?
E) How many hours per week are you hoping to work?
F) Do you have a driver's license?
G) Given the diversity of tasks mentioned above in the lab this summer, what would you be most and least interested in working on?
