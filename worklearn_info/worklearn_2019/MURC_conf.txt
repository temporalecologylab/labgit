Contact info for work learn 

I just want to thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to meet with me. It was so great to hear what you and Kelley have to share.
 

Below, Iâ€™ve included some information about MURC for yourreference:

Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC) 2020
o   March 21, 2020

o   MURC is a conference for UBC undergraduate students to showcase their research in front of their fellow UBC students, family, and friends. Researchers may choose one of two formats to showcase their research: presentation or poster. This may be a good opportunity for students to share their research project, network with peers, and learn about other research that is happening on campus!

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. You can also contact the general email worklearn.iura@ubc.ca for any program specific inquires.

Thanks again for your insights and feedback!

Best Regards,
Sandra
