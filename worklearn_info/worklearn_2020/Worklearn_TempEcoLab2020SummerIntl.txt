Job title:
WL S20 Winegrape data worker in Temporal Ecology Lab

<><><><><><>
Research Title:
Winegrape phenology: Variation within BC and in other regions

<><><><><><>
Outline of Research Project(Required) *
Please provide a high-level overview of the research project. How will the student advance and contribute to the goals of the project?

The Temporal Ecology Lab focuses on how global climate change is altering plants and plant communities locally, regionally and globally. Recent research in our lab has examined how climate change shifts have advanced the timing of plants' leafout and flowering across diverse ecosystems. This summer work will focus on recording the phenology (phenology is the timing of recurring life-history events, i.e., leafout, flowering) of winegrape varieties in BC and collating global data on winegrape phenology. These data will serve two major purposes towards our larger goals of modeling winegrape phenology across regions: (1) Understand how grower-collected data (which we already have for the Okanagan) differs from researcher-collected data; (2) measure and map variation in phenology across regions (the student will work with data from across California, France, the UK, Oregon and potentially Australia or New Zealand).

Student Responsibilities

The student’s main responsibilities will include:
1. Accompanying the lab (graduate students, postdocs and PI Wolkovich) on trips to collect data in the field (mainly Okanagan Valley)
2. Learning the phenological stages (i.e., leafout, flowering, onset of ripening, called 'veraison') of winegrapes (after training and with close supervision)
3. Learning and implementing basic data quality standards for entering and cleaning data collected this summer, as well as long-term records from across California, France, the UK, Oregon and potentially Australia or New Zealand. 

Depending on the students interests and skill development, additional responsibilities could include:
a. Basic analyses of data (the lab has a history of training interested undergraduates in the R programming language, so no previous skills are required for this, just interest).
b. Communicating with growers in-person to better understand differences and similarities in grower- versus researcher-collected data.
c. Communicating their work and findings via the lab's blog and website. 

Supervision

The student will be directly supervised by a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher, both in the field on data collection trips and while in the lab while meeting data quality standards. These immediate supervisors will provide an active and engaging environment for the work-learn student and will meet with the student regularly (often every day depending on the activity, but at least twice/week otherwise) and will be easily available to answer questions as they come up. The principle investigator (Dr. Wolkovich) will also meet with the work-learn student throughout the term (at the start and end of each term and otherwise every two weeks or as needed, whichever is more frequent). 

The goals of the meetings with Dr. Wolkovich are multiple and include: (1) to discuss the work-learn student’s and lab’s current goals (making sure the student understands the scientific aims and reasons for all tasks), (2) check-in regarding training, review methods as needed, and provide feedback to the student as work proceeds, (3) handle any issues that come up and require discussion/supervision and, (4) at the end of the work-learn period discuss continuing opportunities in the lab and the student researcher’s longer term (e.g., career) goals. Additionally Dr. Wolkovich will be available for informal discussion and mentoring during field and lab work periods, and these periods provide an opportunity for Dr. Wolkovich, graduate students, postdocs and work-learn student researchers to work alongside one another in the lab and field.

The work-learn student will be invited to participate in lab meeting and other lab activities, such as journal discussions. Through this position, the student will have the opportunity to better understand the process of conducting ecological research, including experimental design, data collection and archiving, and analysis, while also building diverse professional connections and skills through interactions with researchers and national park employees at field sites.

Qualifications (WL IURA)(Required) *
What skills/knowledge should the student possess to be successful in this job?

The preferred candidate will be an undergraduate and have a basic understanding of ecology and/or physiology in plants---previous experience in a lab or field setting is helpful, though this is not required provided the student has an enthusiasm to learn. A basic background in biology with coursework at the third year or higher is preferred, but also not required.

The biggest qualification for a student is enthusiasm to learn and engage with the research topic. In addition, students who would be a good fit for the position and lab will have strong organization and communication skills, be detail oriented, work well alone and in a team, be interested in building lab and field skills. Students will gain skills in plant and phenological identification, which are important introductory skills for future work in most plant-focused ecology and physiology labs. Additionally these basic skills can be transferred to other lab and field environments.
