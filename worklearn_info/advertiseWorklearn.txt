Engineering courses to advertise in 
From Ken in 2025

All of the first-year engineering students take APSC 101 which is held at the Life Building, Room 2201 during Mondays and Thursdays. There are four classes scheduled at 8-9, 9-10, 3-4, and 4-5. If you are looking for places to just put the posters, maybe you could put them outside LIFE 2201, CHEM B250, and HEBB 100.
There is also an engineering undergrad newsletter with the next edition on March 16. Deadline for submissions is tomorrow (March 13), 9 am. I could try submitting an announcement if you want.
