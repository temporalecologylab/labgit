ALERT! 

In Summer 2023 Lizzie was on sabbatical and we weren't doing winegrape work so these documents are slimmed down. As Deirdre explained:

I revised the summer job ads, removing all mention of the wine grape research and adding a few points. I have attached revised versions. If you think we need more detail let me know. I also removed or edited parts that describe meetings with you, as I assume you will still be on sabbatical for part or most of the summer and not available to do meetings.

*So, may want to check and compare to pre-2023 years*
