# Misc data code?
Started by Lizzie late 2024 as a place to put small amounts of data and code that multiple people might want and are NOT elsewhere in repos.

## pollinationmode
Data from Lizzie's postdoc on which families are wind versus animal. These data are from when I used Subversion so not on github. My files from this time are also messier. I found multiple knownmodesXXX.csv and am uploading what appears to be the lastest one:
- knownmodes2012.csv which comes from a book I had Winny Wen scrape by hand and Ecoflora (an old online resource I think)
- scrub_knownmodes.R (one of several files on my computer but seems the most recent by a couple weeks -- recent being the last edit was 19 March 2012). This file pulls species from NECTAR (an old database) and matches in the data using an OLD taxonscrubber program -- because all this stuff is old, I am only including the knownmodes CSV here and the code as a HELPER, not as something to run (if you really need the other files, tell me). 

*If you use these data and code, PLEASE point to updated code.*
