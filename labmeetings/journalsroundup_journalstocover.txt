Hi all,

We have our first lab meeting in a while this week and I wanted to review the 'journals to cover' part. This is basically a way to share keeping up on the literature. It's meant to be short and info-packed. 

You all have assigned journals (though you have too many, just do ONE of your list this week and remind me that we should update that list). You should review the Table of Contents for you journal and link here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0WdDbjdp8ERLSO7whvtnP-tOblYMlX33TSCXy_uRKo/edit?tab=t.0

To any relevant papers for the lab. 

Then in lab meeting you summarize any papers you found *briefly.* You should aim to speak for UNDER one minute. If you do not see any papers relevant to the lab (which is totally possible) then you just say that ('no really relevant papers in XX journal now'). It's okay to mention papers that are super cool or relevant in a general science way that we should all care about (including how to do science etc.) but please do NOT search for articles or stretch what is relevant just to have an article. And please do not talk too long.

Thanks!
