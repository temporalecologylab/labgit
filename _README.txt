README for labgit

What goes in here?
- Excellent question! 
- You should post general lab info that you are okay having PUBLIC. Be sure not to include items in the `what goes elsewhere?'
- Items should almost always be in in txt, tex or other text-based files. 


What goes elsewhere?
- Methods! We need a lab methods location. 
- Private info. Anything with passwords or info we should not share should be put elsewhere.
